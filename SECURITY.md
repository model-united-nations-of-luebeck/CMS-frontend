# 🔒 Security Policy

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security since, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our systems.

Please follow the principle of responsible disclosure and don't just throw the existence of a security problem out there (in an issue for example) and rather give us a chance to react appropriately.

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities via the button on the top right. Alternatively, please reach out to us via email.

## 🛠️ Supported Versions

We are trying to keep the `main` branch up to date with security fixes. This might not be the case for older branches.
