          <p>
            The process of applying for and getting enrolled into the
            {{ conference_abbr }}
            conference is called registration. In general, registration is
            divided into pre-registration and final registration. The entire
            registration process will be done online on this online registration
            platform. At any time, the Conference Managers are happy to guide
            you through the registration process, let you know what steps to
            take next and answer any questions.

                The aim of pre-registration is to figure out how many schools
                want to attend the conference with how many delegates. During
                pre-registration MUN-Directors basically just show interest to
                take part in the next {{ conference_abbr }} session by
                submitting their school’s name, contact details and most
                importantly a number of students they would like to take to
                Lübeck. Please note, that this is the number of students
                requested. Although the Conference Managers do their best to
                fulfil all requests and constraints, this is not always
                possible. So, it might happen that only a smaller number of
                students will be confirmed by the Conference Managers. Sometimes
                however, places become free again and MUN-Directors might be
                granted to bring more students. The deadline for
                pre-registration is usually before Christmas in December. Make
                sure to transfer the pre-registration fee in time so that the
                Conference Managers can take your delegation into consideration.
                In the past, there we several schools quitting registration at a
                late point and messed up all preparation that’s why the fee was
                introduced. The pre-registration fee will be charged against the
                conference fee, so this is no extra cost for your delegates. Of
                course, we will only charge the number of students the
                Conference Managers confirm, although the fee for the number of
                requested students has to be paid first.

                Within the next couple of weeks, the Conference Managers in
                close cooperation with the Secretaries-General do the country
                allocation. Basically, they decide which delegations (states,
                non-governmental organisations, inter-governmental
                organisations, ...) will be represented in which forums and
                which delegation will be represented by which school. Like this,
                they will determine the number of students they confirm to each
                MUN-Director to bring to the conference and will inform them via
                email about it.

                In the final registration step, MUN-Directors as well as the
                participating students provide some personal information
                required for organizing the conference. As the information is
                personal and protected by data privacy regulations, each
                participating person has to give their consent for the data
                processing and storage first, before the data can be entered.
                Besides personal information like names, titles, email
                addresses, birth dates, diet also some conference-related
                information has to be set, e.g. who is the ambassador of the
                delegation or whether the MUN-Director is an English teacher.
                Participants are also asked to upload a photo in the style of a
                passport photo which will be used to create their badges. Once
                all the information is provided the Conference Managers will
                review everything. They will let you know if anything needs to
                be done or if you’ve just completed the registration
                successfully.
